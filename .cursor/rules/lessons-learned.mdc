# Lessons Learned

This file captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence. It is a living document that grows smarter as we work together.

When you discover a new pattern, preference, or insight during development:
1. Document it immediately in the appropriate section below
2. Validate it with the user if possible
3. Apply it consistently in future work
4. Reference it when making related decisions
